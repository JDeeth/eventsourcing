I'm very grateful for your interest in this library. It has taken quite a
lot of time to create this library. Similarly, it may take some time to
understand the library and develop well-designed event-sourced applications.

To supplement the detailed documentation, professional training workshops
and development services are available. Friendly community support is also
available on the Slack_ channel.

Please support the continuing development and maintenance of this library
by `starring the project on GitHub <https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/eventsourcing>`_
and if possible by making a regular donation. If you have any issues using
the library or reading the documentation, please `raise an issue on GitHub
<https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/eventsourcing/issues>`_,
feel free to start a discussion in the Slack_ channel, or create a pull request.


Professional support
====================

Design and development services are available to help developers and managers
with the development and management of their event-sourced applications and systems.

- Development of working applications and systems for production use.
- Development of sample applications and systems for guidance or demonstration purposes.
- Overall assessment of your existing implementation, with recommendations for improvement.
- Address specific concerns with how your event-sourced application or system is built and run.
- Coaching developers in the use of the library.

Please contact John Bywater via the Slack_ channel for more information about professional
support.


Training workshops
==================

Training workshops are available to help developers more
quickly learn how to use the library. Workshop participants
will be guided through a series of topics, gradually discovering
what the library is capable of doing, and learning how to use
the library effectively.

Please contact John Bywater via the Slack_ channel for more information about
training workshops.
